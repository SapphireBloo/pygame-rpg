# 🎃 Chin Check Charlie 🥊  
**A Halloween RPG of Ghosts, Candy, and Chin Checks**  

---

**Chin Check Charlie** is a quirky, Halloween-themed 2D RPG where you play as **Chin Check Charlie**, a tough-as-nails hero wandering through haunted lands in search of candy, answers, and a fight.

Battle spooky enemies, collect candy to unlock upgrades, and survive the whispers of **Whisper Jack**, the ghostly voice in your head who's got advice... and maybe an agenda.



## ⚠️ Status: Still Under Construction!  

This project is an active **work-in-progress**. Core gameplay systems are playable:

- **Exploration Mode** (Side-scrolling adventure)  
- **Battle System** (Turn-based combat with ghosts and goblins)  
- **Candy Shop Upgrades** (Spend your hard-earned candy for buffs)  
- **Dynamic Animations** (Characters, ghosts, skeletons)  

But:  
> Expect some **missing features**, placeholder art, and candy wrappers on the floor while we build this haunted house.

✨ Why "Chin Check Charlie"?
Because when ghosts show up, someone’s gotta throw hands.
And it’s Halloween — candy is serious business.
